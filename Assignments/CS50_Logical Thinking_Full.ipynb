    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will craft arguments in favor of each side of a “would you rather” question. You must then analyze the arguments in full, making strong applications of all of the logical thinking HCs. The arguments can be as simple or as sophisticated as you wish! Keep in mind that more complicated arguments will require a richer, more careful analysis. This may be a good way to showcase your knowledge, but could also lead to more flaws. Moreover, in pursuit of the appropriate difficulty level, you’ll notice several “Optional” problems throughout the assignment to challenge yourself. These will only be scored if they are completed correctly with thorough explanation. If you attempt an optional challenge but do not succeed, you will not be penalized with a low score.\n",

There are two parts below, and in each part, you will argue a different side of the argument for your chosen question. For example, if your question was, “Would you rather code in Python or code in Java?”, you would focus on one side only in PART 1: “I would rather code in Python.” In PART 2, you would craft an inductive argument for the other side, “I would rather code in Java.” **Please review the guidelines and examples provided to help you write effective arguments in the assignment instructions on Forum.**"

    "1. <font color = \"red\">Denying the antecedent (1-2)</font>: In the 2nd premise, even if I don't choose the car, there are  other reasons I won't be safe (e.g. knife cutting). This formal fallacy made the argument **invalid** and the conclusion `false`. To construct a valid deduction, this premise should be replaced by another like <font color = \"blue\">*I want to be safe*</font> ($S$), then the first two premises ($C → ¬S$, $S$), can reach <font color = \"green\">*modus tollens*</font> ($¬C$).\n",

    "1 | ¬C → S | S → ¬C\n",
    "2 | H → S | S → H\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a fallacy because it's not a bicondition. <font color = \"blue\">*If I don't choose the self-driving car, then I will be safe*</font> is not logically equivalent to <font color = \"blue\">*To be safe, I won't choose the self-driving car*</font>. There are other ways for me <font color = \"blue\">*to be safe*</font>, not just <font color = \"blue\">*choose the self-driving car*</font> (e.g. drive carefully on the road). To correct this fallacy, the 2nd premise $¬C → S$ can be changed into $¬C ↔ S$, or be deleted as indicated above\n",

While working on the assignment, I frequently consulted those notes to review my knowledge (<font color = \"purple\">*generation effect & spaced practice*</font>). For example, I have this [Fallacy Cheat Sheet](https://www.notion.so/fb112df882c8487eb4d1426d54cf08b5?v=ccf11e46b93147c6b5545e547ae3f0df) for constructing fallacious arguments, or [Induction VS Deduction](https://www.notion.so/3-2-Induction-a0ce3e805a8a484ba0b48259e9b14011) to identify argument types. I also tried different questions (<font color = \"purple\">*interleaving*</font>) when I got stuck or bored to keep me working (chance for <font color = \"purple\">*deliberate practice*</font>). Smooth application of those principles get me more comfortable working with <font color = \"orange\"> #induction, #deduction, #algorithms </font>, and <font color = \"orange\">#fallacies</font>.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. I was aware that logical thinking is useful to derive a good <font color = \"orange\">#algorithms</font> in coding as computers need such guidance (<font color = \"orange\">#interpretivelens</font>). Through classes and the assignment, I learned more about how natural language can be coded into formal logic, and how I can test those with code. It helped me realize how I can also use logical thinking in daily language (<font color = \"orange\">#openmindedness</font>), especially reading news so that I can no longer be easily appealed (<font color = \"orange\">#critique</font>)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. For the assignment, I mostly consulted [my personal notes](https://www.notion.so/e8a8d28614a046e9be7fe6d5efe992d3?v=c5e5ef1c479243b3b013ff71ca8100a4) I summarized from readings. If I felt that I cannot complete a part to my expectation (aiming for a 4) with my own knowledge, I'll first come back to the session where it was taught and reviewed the readings. Usually that's enough, but I'll search Google if needed (self-check code and check <font color = \"orange\">#sourcequality</font>). For markdown, I searched for building table & text color in [IBM Cheat Sheet](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed). To construct truth tables, I referenced [tr3buchet's repo on Github](https://github.com/tr3buchet/truths/tree/master/truths) (though I failed, at least I tried) "
